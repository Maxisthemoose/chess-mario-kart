-teleport: swap one piece of any color with the piece you just moved (have it like a diameter of like 5 
-mimic: if a pawn uses this it can gain the movement of any piece --- maybe not any piece, or maybe only for like, one or two turns
-extra life (one up): you don’t get a piece taken out just moved to the next available position 
-rank up: a piece can turn into a new piece pawn-rook-knight-bishop-queen 
-double jump: you can hop over a piece like in checkers
-rapid pace: you can move a piece twice 
-restart: you can put a piece in it’s starting position (optional make it so if a piece is there you can use this or if it’s an enemy you take the enemy piece)
-trade out: you can sacrifice one piece to get one back (you have to sacrifice two pawns) 

-lightning: makes opponents pieces "smaller" and unable to move as far, ex: full range pieces like rook can only move maybe 4 spaces
-freeze: freeze any piece of your choice in place. the frozen piece can not move, but also can not be taken.
-star: invincibility for some time (maybe 3 turns?), pieces that try to attack are instead taken by the invincible piece. Can't be aquired by free move pieces (rook, bishop, queen), or pieces that are powered up to move like them
-pow: stun the other side and allow you to go again (any piece). Chance to stun you instead and let the other side make two moves
-super mush: allow that piece to move again
-boo: steals powerup from random enemy. If no enemy has powerup, bring random low power item from specific pool.
-fireball: chance to take selected piece, otherwise stuns for piece for a turn. Maybe also burn "tick" that limits movement 

-piece themed ups: turn a piece into another piece for a turn. ex: Pawn picks up rook powerup -> next turn can move like rook.


-powerup powerups after certain amount of moves.
